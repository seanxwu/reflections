Now we are using github, remote depository

:git remote [-v]          #option v = verbose
:git push origin master   #push master from local to remote as origin
:git pull                 #pull from remote to local

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
